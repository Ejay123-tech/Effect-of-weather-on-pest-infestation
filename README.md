# ðŸŒ¾ Effect of Weather on Pest Infestation

This project analyzes how weather patterns affect pest infestation levels in crops.  
It uses machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the **Severity Level** of pest attacks based on features like **Location**, **Season/Month**, **Crop Stage Affected**, and **Trigger Condition**.
